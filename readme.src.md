## Rationale

I wasn't aware of any live CSS editors at the time. However upon finding them, they seem to live as extensions for those browsers. You'd need to download and install the extension on each browser. 
		
Styling on Internet Explorer is a pain and quite unfairly it does not have the extension ecosystem enjoyed in the other 'modern' browsers. This editor is to accommodate those developers that need to use IE and make their lives a little easier
