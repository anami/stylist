# Stylist

Add and edit live CSS to any page in any modern browser... and have the changes persist everytime you run the bookmarklet on the page.

Visit the [Stylist](http://anami.github.io/stylist "Stylist") page and copy the "Run Stylist" link as a bookmark - click the bookmark on the page you wish to change...

You may want a different look to a page that you regularly visit or help you style a page that you are developing.

Once you have clicked the bookmarklet - the panel should open and you're good to go..

## Rationale

I wasn't aware of any live CSS editors at the time. However upon finding them, they seem to live as extensions for those browsers. You'd need to download and install the extension on each browser. 
		
Styling on Internet Explorer is a pain and quite unfairly it does not have the extension ecosystem enjoyed in the other 'modern' browsers. This editor is to accommodate those developers that need to use IE and make their lives a little easier
