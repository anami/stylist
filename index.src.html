		<h1>Stylist</h1>
		<p>Add and edit live CSS on any page in any modern browser.. and have the changes persist everytime you run the bookmarklet on the page.</p>
		<p>You may want a different look to a page that you regularly visit or help you style a page that you are developing.</p>
		<p>Simply copy the link above as a bookmark - click the bookmark on the page you wish to change...</p>
		<p>Once you have clicked the bookmarklet - the panel should open and you're good to go..</p>

		<h1>Rationale</h1>
		<p>I wasn't aware of any live CSS editors at the time. However upon finding them, they seem to live as extensions for those browsers. You'd need to download and install the extension on each browser. </p>
		<p>Styling on Internet Explorer is a pain and quite unfairly it does not have the extension ecosystem enjoyed in the other 'modern' browsers. This editor is to accommodate those developers that need to use IE and make their lives a little easier.</p>
		<p>It also allows styles to be moved from browser to browser to ensure the CSS is valid on all browsers. Potentially saving you heaps of time!</p>
